## dependencies:
- **Backend**
   - [go-cairo](https://github.com/ungerik/go-cairo) cairo the image manipulation library
   - [goarabic](https://github.com/01walid/goarabic) the amazing arabic text library that saved my from generating PDFs from scratch ðŸ™‚
   - [dsc_logo_generator](https://github.com/mbaraa/dsc_logo_generator/) this might sound a bit weird, but the `Text` type defined in there is actually useful with cairo ðŸ˜‡

- **NON SOFTWARE** 
   - [GeezaFontInterface](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/system-fonts/#downloadable) I don't know what license this font has, but as I understood from there website this font is allowe in non-commercial use, so I guess I'm allowed to use it ðŸ˜‡, or am I ??!
