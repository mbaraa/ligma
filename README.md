# Sheev 

**What's `Sheev` you might ask?**\
This thing generates image forms, much wow!

**Well you might ask... why the hell would anyone do this while PDF forms are all over the place?**\
I use this for forms that are not PDF, and besides I didn't find a free suitable PDF forms library for Go so...
