# Ligma 

**What's `Ligma` you might ask?**\
Ligma foooorms ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,\
alright whatever ðŸ˜‡ this thing generates forms, much wow!

**Well you might ask... why the hell would anyone do this while PDF forms are all over the place?**\
I use this for forms that are not PDF, and besides I didn't find a free suitable PDF forms library for Go so...
